2021-09-03: Used the 09_arctic_hydrology_transport demo to start setting up simulations with tracer for Sebastian.
            The xml was not running immediately, so I updated using the input converter 1.1-main and fixed some errors
            based on error messages. As I could see no sign of a tracer in the results, I replaced the list:

            <ParameterList name="source terms">
              <ParameterList name="concentration">
                <ParameterList name="SOURCE: Tracer">
                  <Parameter name="regions" type="Array(string)" value="{tracer application}" />
                  <Parameter name="spatial distribution method" type="string" value="volume" />
                  <Parameter name="component names" type="Array(string)" value="{tracer}" />
                  <ParameterList name="source function">
                    <ParameterList name="function-tabular">
                      <Parameter name="y values" type="Array(double)" value="{0.0001, 0}" />
                      <Parameter name="x values" type="Array(double)" value="{1555200,17280000}" />
                      <Parameter name="forms" type="Array(string)" value="{constant}" />
                    </ParameterList>
                  </ParameterList>
                </ParameterList>
              </ParameterList>
            </ParameterList>

            With one from https://github.com/amanzi/ats-regression-tests/blob/master/06_transport/subsurface_tracer.xml
            Looking like:

            <ParameterList name="source terms" type="ParameterList">
              <ParameterList name="component mass source" type="ParameterList">
                <ParameterList name="tracer2" type="ParameterList">
                <Parameter name="regions" type="Array(string)" value="{well}" />
                <Parameter name="spatial distribution method" type="string" value="none" />
                <Parameter name="component names" type="Array(string)" value="{Tracer2}" />
                <ParameterList name="source function" type="ParameterList">
                  <Parameter name="number of dofs" type="int" value="1" />
                  <ParameterList name="dof 1 function">
                    <ParameterList name="function-constant" type="ParameterList">
                      <Parameter name="value" type="double" value="1.0" />
                    </ParameterList>
                  </ParameterList>
                </ParameterList>
              </ParameterList>
            </ParameterList>
          </ParameterList>

          Still not sure what this actually does! In the output, tracer = 0 all the time, but a tracer can be seen in
          total concentration in VisIt. Also played with the location, concentration, and timing of the tracer, and
          added a hillslope mesh.
To do:    Make a better mesh (less deep?). Apply Disko data, and run spinup. Set up a fancy repo to  share with Sebastian,
          and if needed ATS developers.

2021-09-04: Set up directory for simulations: Documents/Research/projects/Sebastian/Disco/disko_ats/
            Made a column mesh and set up spin up simulations for the disko site.
            freezeup.xml is based on xml-file from ats-demos/06_arctic_hydrology and sets hydrostatic
            conditions and freezes column from below, using parameterization mainly from old Disko simulations,
            and for wrm a mix with those in the original freezeup.xml file, as simulations crashed using the
            wrm parameter settings from old disko runs.
            /scripts/column_data.py contains some python code to generate column_data.h5 from column simulations
            output for using as initial conditions for later runs. This code is copied mainly from
            ATS_SRC_DIR/tools/utils/column_data.py, which I could not get to run as is. Note that column mesh has top z
            coordinate = 0, and decreasing to negative  values down the mesh, while the 2d mesh has 100 as the top z coordinate.
            Tested running transient simulations with disko data (and Tavva data for shortwave rad) on both column and
            2d mesh based on output from spinup.
To do:      -check input parameters and data with Sebastian.
            -check how much spin up is needed for simulations
            -snow cover currently reaches 2 meters in the winter.
            -transport model is coupled but not sure what it does and how it should look
            -observation output needs to be set up.
            -boundary conditions? How long time series for climate data do we have?
2021-09-09: Input parameters checked with Sebastian. WRM parameters changes (slightly) and run equally well as the ones from 
            the demo for freezeup.xml and transient_column.xml. Permeability values from local observations are higher than those
             from the demo (if they are correct!) by about two orders of magnitude. Higher permeabilities gives slower runs, but 
             the new values (~1e-9) give appr. equal run times for the freezeup.xml and transient_ccolumn.xml. Changing the thermal
             conductivity from 2.2 to 1 for the mineral soil results in the freezeup solumn not being completely frozen after 1000 years.
             Set up SEB boundary conditions for transient_column.xml based on idealized/smooth data from Sebastian, using bc.py. 
             transient_column.xml run 10 years with different snow and checking stability of active layer thickness. With 3times the snow
             precip from SEbastians data, snow thickness reaches around 60 cm in winter and active layer is still increases (at 1.2 m)
             after 10 years. Changed bottom boundary to 270.65 K. The increasing AL may be due to the column setup missing moisture
             dynamics and stability should be checked on the slope simulation.
To do:       
             - add observations output to transient_slope.xml
             - make new meshes based on data from Sebastian
             - set up transient_slope.xml with new data and parameters
             - check/calibrate snow thickness, and potential other variables with observations.
